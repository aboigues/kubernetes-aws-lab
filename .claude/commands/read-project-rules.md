# Read Project Rules

IMPORTANT: Before working on ANY task in this project, you MUST read the complete project rules documentation.

## Your Task

1. Read the complete file `/home/user/kubernetes-aws-lab/docs/PROJECT-RULES.md`
2. Acknowledge that you have read and understood all the project rules
3. Confirm which specific rules are relevant to the current task

## Why This Is Critical

The PROJECT-RULES.md document contains:
- Mandatory naming conventions for files, sessions, and resources
- Required code standards for Bash, Terraform, and Python
- Deployment processes and workflows
- Security rules and best practices
- Architecture decisions and constraints
- Cost management rules
- Documentation standards

Failing to follow these rules will result in:
- ❌ Non-compliant code that doesn't match project standards
- ❌ Deployment failures due to incorrect naming
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities from missing best practices
- ❌ Inconsistent documentation
- ❌ Increased costs from improper resource management

## Read the Rules Now

Use the Read tool to read: `/home/user/kubernetes-aws-lab/docs/PROJECT-RULES.md`

After reading, provide a brief summary of the key rules relevant to the current task.
